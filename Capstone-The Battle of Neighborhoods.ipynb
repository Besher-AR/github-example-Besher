Population density of a locality\n2. Per Capital income\n3. Population of each location\n4. Venues in each locality   \n\nThe category of the venues that he's interested in are:\n\n1. Arts and Entertainment\n2. Shops & Service\n3. College and University\n4. Event\n5. Food\n6. Nightife Spot\n7. Outdoors & Recreation\n7. Professional & Other places\n8. Residence\n9.

List of all venues in each city\n2. List of all venues in each locality in the selected city\n\nUsing the above data we will first select best city to proceed with based on the values like Population density, per capita income of the state, number of venues (as we are giving weights to each venue based on its category).\n\nOnce we select a city, we then go hunting for Localities. Again, we do it using the same approach i.e. based on the scores of venues in each locality.",
